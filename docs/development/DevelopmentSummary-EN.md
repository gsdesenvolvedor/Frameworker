# Essential Features

### MVC architecture:
Implement Model-View-Controller architecture to separate the application logic, data handling, and presentation layers. This promotes a clean and maintainable codebase.

### Routing:
Provide an easy-to-use routing system to handle various types of request URLs and map them to specific controllers and methods.

### Auto-loading:
Implement an auto-loading mechanism for loading classes, libraries, and other dependencies automatically, without the need for manual inclusion.

### Database abstraction and ORM:
Include a database abstraction layer and an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for working with databases in a more object-oriented and efficient manner.

### Input validation and filtering:
Offer built-in support for input validation, filtering, and sanitization to protect against security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and Cross-site Scripting (XSS).

### Configurable and modular:
Design the framework to be easily configurable and modular, allowing developers to enable or disable specific features and extend the framework with custom modules.

### Template engine:
Integrate a template engine like Twig or Blade for easier and cleaner management of the application's views and layouts.

### Caching:
Provide built-in caching mechanisms to improve the application's performance by storing frequently-used data or rendered views in memory or external storage.

### Security features:
Implement security features such as CSRF protection, XSS filtering, and secure password hashing to protect the applications built with the framework.

### Error handling and debugging:
Offer an error handling system that catches and logs errors, and provides a user-friendly way to display error messages. Include debugging tools and a profiler to help developers diagnose performance issues and other problems.

### Localization and internationalization:
Support localization and internationalization for building applications that cater to users with different languages and regional preferences.

### Documentation:
Provide thorough and clear documentation for all features and functionalities of the framework, along with code examples and best practices.
